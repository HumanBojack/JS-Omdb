This is a little js program that uses the omdb api to fetch movies from you search, there is also a popup that gives you more infos.
You must provide an api key to use the thing, otherwise your search will be "harry potter" by default and popups wont work. (You also need to change the fetch
commented lines if you're using an api key)

Thank you
